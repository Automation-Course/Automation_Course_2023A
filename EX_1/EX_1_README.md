# Binary <-> Decimal Calculator

## Summary
This python program can convert any binary input into decimal and vice versa.  
Any other input will cause an error message, but won't crash the program.  

## How To Use
### Supported modes
The calculator supports two modes: binary-to-decimal (`2->10`) and decimal-to-binary (`10->2`).  
The default mode of the calculator is decimal-to-binary.  


### Execute Script
The calculator can be used by running the python script.  
You can either run the program in a python environment, or using the command line:  
from the main repository directory (`Automation_Course_2023A`), run: `python EX_1/calculator.py`


### Valid Inputs
1. `quit`: quit the program.
2. `mode`: see what mode you are at the moment. can be either `2->10` or `10->2`.
3. `2->10`: changes mode to binary-to-decimal.
4. `10->2`: changes mode to decimal-to-binary.

Other than these commands, every other input should be a number in the matching base.
